- Add 2 tbsp of butter and 2 tbsp olive oil to a large pan over medium heat. 
- Add red pepper flakes, pepper, onion, and shallot and saute until slightly caramelized.
- Add garlic and stir until fragrant, about 40 seconds. 
- Bring a large pot of water to a rolling boil and add a generous amount of salt, and 
the 1 lb. pasta of choice. Add frozen peas or broccoli now. Cook until 1 minute before 
al dente and reserve 1 cup of pasta water. 
- Add 1 cup of vodka to deglaze the pan, stirring vigorously. Allow the alcohol to cook 
out for at least 10 minutes or until the strong vodka smell goes away. 
- After the alcohol cooks off, add the tomato sauce and allow to reduce until a spoon 
dragged through the sauce leaves a trail, or until it is a deep red color. 
- Turn the heat down to low and add the cream slowly, stirring constantly to not break 
the sauce. Add spinach now.
- Add the pasta and water to the finished sauce, stirring vigorously to combine. 
Salt if necessary and plate, topping with Parmesan cheese.
