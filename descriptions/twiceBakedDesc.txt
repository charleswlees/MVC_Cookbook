- Preheat the oven to 400 degrees.
- Scrub and dry potatoes
- Rub potatoes in olive oil and crack salt and pepper all over the skins. Wrap in foil and 
bake for 1 hour or until the potatoes are fork-tender but still sturdy. 
- Allow potatoes to cool slightly and cut in half with a sharp knife, being careful not to 
pull at the potato skin too much. 
- Carefully scoop out the potato filling and transfer to a medium bowl, and place the potato 
skins in a large glass baking dish closely together. 
- In a large glass measuring cup, combine the milk, cream, and butter and microwave for 
1 minute, stirring every 15 seconds. 
- Slowly combine the warm milk and butter mixture with the potatoes, mashing until smooth.
- Add salt, pepper, and shredded cheese to taste. Mix well.
- Spoon the mashed potatoes back into the skins, and top with extra cheese and any other 
toppings you like. 
- Cover the potatoes in aluminum foil and bake for 15 minutes, taking the foil off for the 
last 5 minutes. 
- Remove from oven and cool for 2 minutes before serving.
