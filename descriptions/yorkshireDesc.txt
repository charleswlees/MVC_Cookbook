- Turn the oven up to 250 and pour the pan drippings into a 9x9 inch pan or an 11x7 inch pan. 
- Put the pan in the oven to keep sizzling while you prepare the batter.
- Combine the eggs, milk, floud, and salt. Beat until well blended.
- Pour batter into the prepared pan and bake 25-30 minutes. 
- Serve piping hot from the baking pan, a generous square with each helping of roast.
