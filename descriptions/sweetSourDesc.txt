- In a large glass baking dish, spread your Russian or Catalina dressing 
on the bottom just to cover, laying chicken on top.
- Sprinkle onion soup mix evenly on top of chicken tenders.
- Top the chicken with the remaining dressing as well as small scoops of 
apricot preserves. 
- Bake at 425 degrees Fahrenheit for 40 minutes and remove from oven. 
Top with drained pineapple and return to oven for 5-7 minutes, or 
until the sauce is bubbling and the pineapple is cooked. 
- Allow to cool 5 minutes before serving. Serve with rice and vegetables- 
our favorite is sweet green peas or fresh steamed green beans!
