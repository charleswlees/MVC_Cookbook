- Chop up one pound of russet potatoes and a 1/2 cup of onion and prepare a tablespoon of 
flour and two tablespoons of bacon grease.
- Drain the clams from the cans and prepare 8oz clam juice (it's better to use bottled 
juice rather than what is left in the cans).
- Heat the bacon grease in a pan and saute the onions until translucent, but not browned. 
- Add the diced potatoes and saute until all the potato has been coated by fat. Add the 
flour and saute until the potatoes and onions have been coated.
- Pour in the cup of clam juice and bring to a boil while stirring. Once the mixture 
comes to a boil, reduce to a simmer with the lid on. Cook with lid on for 20 mins or 
until the potatoes become tender.
- Prepare a mixture of one cup whole milk and one cup heavy cream. 
- After simmering potatoes for 20 mins / until potatoes are tender, stir to redistribute 
the solids
- Add drained clams, milk, and cream.
- Stir and heat until hot but not boiling.
- Season and enjoy!
