- Preheat Oven to 450
- Rub fat side of beef with oil, onion powder, and garlic powder. Place in large roasting pan,
bone side down (if boneless, place on cradle).
- Pour a small amount of water, enough to cover the bottom of the pan, and sprinkle two small 
onions sliced in the water.
- Place uncovered roast in oven at 450 for 15 minutes
- Reduce heat to 350 and continue to cook meat until done to your own preference.
- Insert a meat thermometer, not too close to the bone, after the first hour.
130-140: beef is rare
150-160: beef is medium
160-170: beef is well-done

I recommend using a thermometer that has a probe that you can leave in the roast.
I take it out when it gets to 115 and tent it with aluminum foil.
Once the center reaches 125 take off the foil until it reaches 140.
